                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I'm Zak, a Software Engineering Major at Utah Tech University.
                    I enjoy playing the guitar as well as skateboarding, but programming
                    and making games for fun are my favorite hobbies.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Zak Breitenstein. I'm currently 22 years old, and I'm a junior
                    at Utah Tech University in the Software Engineering program. I originally began attending Dixie
                    State University back in Fall of 2019, which was when I took the original Web Design class. In
                    2020, I took a break after the Fall semester because I was struggling to get things done with the
                    online schooling format. I'd just lost all my motivation and wanted to try doing something else,
                    so I got a job as a fuel attendant at Fabulous Freddy's (Image above is me in uniform). After a
                    little while I decided to go back, and now I'm doing better than ever before.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I originally got into programming at around age 12. I was learning simple,
                    pretty niche scripting languages that were native to programs I liked to use to create games. I really
                    enjoyed seeing the code I created do things on screen. I felt like I could do anything I wanted, and
                    for the most part, that's still the way that I see programming. I think it's a lot of fun to make
                    applications, although often challenging. Once I got older, I started becoming more serious about 
                    programming and software engineering which led to me becoming a Computer Science major at Dixie.
                    I ended up changing majors to Software Engineering and that's where I'm currently at now.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of programming, I'm also really into music. I play the guitar,
                        and I also occasionally compose my own songs. It's a fun hobby, but it's not something I'm really
                        all that serious about. I also skateboard from time to time and go running or jogging late at night. 
                        I've put a decent amount of time into learning 3D modelling and graphic design on my own time, mostly 
                        for the sake of making games, but I still have a lot to learn. I love learning how to do a bunch of
                        different things. I'm definitely not great at a lot of things, but I would say I'm good at picking up 
                        new skills quickly. That's why I'd say that adaptability is my greatest strength.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, I'm obviously looking to become a Software Engineer.
                    I don't really have any idea what sort of company I'd like to end up at. I have some connections to
                    people that are currently working in the industry, but they come from very different backgrounds
                    to me. I don't know where exactly I fit in, but I'm looking forward to hopefully finding out.
                    Until then I'm just trying to enjoy the ride.

                <p>Unfortunately, I don't have any social links to share! I'm not big on social media, but I feel
                    that at some point, I'll likely be forced to have some sort of social media presence.
